## what

- Starnet
  - a board-like game
  - with a server and regular events(tournaments)
  - complete, free and open to everyone
  - to be worthy of a scene and community around

## on games in general

- games are fundamentally magic, one of the better ways for beings to interact
- games are being 'produced', but suprisingly, there are no events to play
  - most games are micro heavy, dark, including the classics
  - monetization noise is unhelathy and disturbing
  - events(tournaments) are rare, not for everyone, brackets are on separate services
  - prolifiration of the idea that the player must be an unhealthy aggry yob, seeking for life-replacing occupation that is also 10-hour-a-day-or-bust
  - force into one mindset: compete for resources, collect more, bring opponent down
- there is a glaring need for games that are
  - simplier, lighter, have no micro
  - have a map (board)
  - are a service, can be played/observed in a browser, events and brackets included
  - are complex and interesting enough to be worhty of a community around
  - are moneytization free, come as whole available for everyone, no forced 'if you don't play, you have limit access to updates'

## observaions

- HoMM3
  - AI battles are repetetive
  - little role of combining enetities
  - simulteneous turns save the day
- AoE, Starcraft
  - micro heavy
- Hearthstone Battlegrounds
  - mode is brilliant
- Terraria
  - softer graphics, but still dark
  - amazing idea and design

## user experience

- events (tournaments, matches) are at the center, home page contains official events and most upvoted
  - games tend to have reasonable duration time, so most events have estimatable start and finish time, they can be  planned for
  - event rounds start at X, no waiting for the opponent
  - official events start at X, not when full
  - users can create events (invite only or public), unset time constraints
- players have rating, rating can be reset
- all games are public and can be observed
- the game opens in a tab, so can be always reopened/reconnected
- users can
  - press 'find an opponent' and be auto matched against most equal opponent (or can decline)
  - enter an event
  - create/configure an open/invite-only  event
  - browse events (with a filter)
  - join a game
  - create an open/invite-only game (no title, match description has a format)
  - browse open games (with a filter)
  - create lists of
    - other users
    - events
    - users and events
    - as there will be no limitations like 'add to friends' 'follow' etc. - user creates their own lookup lists
  - export (to load, exahnge) game as data
    - load can be a url to a file (edn or transit, possibly edn for readabiity)
- no chat
- user profile has rating and event results (can be reset)
- official and community map templates and configurable events
- pre game bans, selections
- observing
  - select templates (simple detailed) for game info/stats [templates are components]
  - toggle visibility of a player's entities to better see the position of one player
- tournament time frames
  - tounaments preferably have estimatable, evening/a day timeframe
    - once signup ends, bracket is form, countdown to round 1 begins
    - player sees 'upcoming match in X:X;
    - game starts automatically or player can decline and take a default loss
    - once round ends, next countdown begins
    - players can see the brackets and schedule
  - tounaments can be configured to have natuaral timeframe
    - all standard
    - to observe or play the game user clicks the match in the bracket, gets into the game lobby or game itself
    - players can mutually agree to nullify the result and re-play

## starnet game

### story

  - defend starnet, one shot opportunity of preventing launch of netconrol (controldrone)
  - research, change, build, balance a missiondrone and a team (a hero and research drones)
    - the winner's missiondrone and team will take on the mission of protecting startnet from netcontrol's takeover
  - planets & teleports, remote controlled drones, ships
  - single map
  - start: teleport to the map (a planet)
  - players play for competing/fighting team, both thinking their missiondrone and team will perform better than opponents, so better build wins
  - entities vary, sets, tags, combinations: code,warp drives, fields, elements, fruit, self orient time .. etc.
  - characters, reserach drones start from 0

### gameplay

  - a tiled map
  - player collects varios items, chooses different options, experiencing effects to build a better missionship
  - game is values-transparent with little things to learn, provides calculations, more focuss on the picture and decisions, less arithmetics
  - maps , items quantities and even qualities are randomized
  - randomness on initial generation only
  - optimal game time ~15-90 min

### balance

- goal is game completeness, balance, so complete set of entities, no bloating expansions
  - entities have tags(sets): gathering organic discovery etc.
  - droids
    - drive types 
    - research abilities
    - distance speed
  - combine parts compute fields drives etc.
  - research quality
  - compute capabilities
  - decision making accuracy, energy, vision, vitality

### game 0.1

- players (azure and orange) start on the map, charachter is represented with a cape
- 1 hero, 3 research drones (represented with a colored sphere)
- missiondrone is represented with a large sphere (possible made of nanites) and orbiting supporting spheredrones
- map is visible and open to both opponents equally, 128x128
- players are not competing for resources, what one can get, the other can as well
- players choose their initial position on the map 
- research, collect, rebalance, by roaming the map
- players choose what to visit and collect, make choices, balance the missiondrone's and the team's characterisitics
- players see each others moves, but not choices (the missiondrone build, team's stats etc.)
- player can visit a fruit tree to improve certain skills of a hero, for example, or visit and select nanite modules for the missiondrone
- players have limited moves per day, limited days (say, 7)
- total time for 7 days - 15min
- every 5 mins there is an battle simulation, 30sec per move, 3rd battle is final
- in the battle goal is to disable(defeat) opponent's mission drone
- hero and research drones are engaged and support (they also develop skills and abilities)
- no distance
  - movement in terms of energy spent at places, maybe increasable limit on how many places can be visited
  - visiting a lot should not matter though 
- missiondrone attributes
  - compute capabilities
  - data bank
  - knowledge bank
  - independent agent programs (for unpredictability)
  - fields
  - networking range
  - design quility
  - human interface simplicity
  - abstraction level (like an age in AoE)
  - defensive/offensive resources
  - energy
  - ...
- hero
  - accuracy
  - decisionmaking
  - resolve
  - drone design 
  - reach (movement)
  - creativity(ideas)
  - endurance (energy)
  - vision
- reserach drone
  - reach
  - reserach capabilites
  - absctraction level
  - fields
  - hull
  - energy
  - hoisting (carrying) capacity

## how

- use repl from the start as it's the most powerful design tool, will inform the design

### cloud

- first, setup CD to the cloud - project must live
- fixed single server instance
  - aws
    - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
    - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/amazon-ecs-and-docker-volume-drivers-amazon-ebs/
    - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing/
    - https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/
  - https://github.com/localstack/localstack
  - persist data via docker volumes and EBS

### system

- CPS communicating sequential processes
  - https://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-core-async/
    - "function chains are poor machines
    - "good programs should be made out of processes and queues
    - "the 'api du jours' events/calbacks - Definition of du jour. 1 : made for a particular day
    - "external flow state
  - https://clojure.org/news/2013/06/28/clojure-clore-async-channels
  - https://github.com/clojure/core.async
<br/><br/>
- queues and processes
- a thing for a purpose: abstract only if obvious immediate reuse
- spec fns when needed
- processes know only args: pass channels explicitly
- main file creates channels, imports and starts processes
<br/><br/>
- kafka (as event/record store)
- datalog db (crux) to index data
  - most data (not write-intensive) is persisted in crux's topics
  - in-game events (higher throughput) flow through a dedicated kafka topic
  - game as an enetity (low throughput) is persisted without state (has a ref) and is queryable as users and other data

### game state

- the game is powerful, so is the client
- game is not computed on the server
- game state is persisted on the server in compact form as {:game-events []}
- client being powerful, computes all the needed derived/queryable state for interactivity
  - derived state may be a map {:derived1 {} :derived2 {} ..}
  - on every event, relevant deriver fns are invoked (derived1 ctx evt), where ctx contains all refs
  - derived1 computes and updates :derived1 key in the map
  - also a derived-db must be used (as a proper abstraction over joins) to store entities in in-memory, with a language like e.g. datalog
- if client tab is closed
  -  client reconnects
  -  server sends the compact state 
  -  client recomputes the game state as (apply next-state (into default-game-events game-events )) (recompute-derive-whaterver-is-needed ..)
- if no disconnect, client receives only new game events and updates the game state
- but server adds timestamps - so time is independent from the client
- games are stored in db to be queryable/joinable: transacted on creation, completion or configuration
- game state is a record of another topic, changed on in-game events


### assets

- use s-expressions to gen svg
- colors, lines, shapes (for cape, spheres, facilities, skills, fruit tree etc.)
- use DOM for the board, but keep it simple - details and info in windows/popups/panels
- file per asset, little to no shared code, an asset as sexp, use lib, render into canvas/svg/png
- gen assets into files, preload, set as sources to tiles
- if needed, run assets as code (render into svg/canvas) in enetity information window, 
- point is: assets are code, files are generated
- but first: events, words, simple shapes; assets will form last

### documentation

- github repo with .md files
- docs, anouncements, release notes: simple dirs with index.md containing links to file per posting

### steps

- setup clj cljs cljc
- clojure.async clojure.spec test.check
- add tests, pad
- setup kafka, kafka docs, experiment
- choose a datalog db
- user abstraction: identity, crud
- add http(s)
- auth tokens
- user abstraction: ui via CSP
- sockets
- simple game: tiles with values

### considerations

- figwheel main if it's less cpu consuming than shadow-cljs
- search
  - used only for events, games, users
- data and secutiry
  - user account data only exists in user.data
  - if user deletes their account, it gets removed from user.data (kafka tombstone event)
  - in the system (event brackets, stats etc.) it get's shown as 'unknown' (only uuid is used in other topics)
- v0.1 ux
  - users creates a game -> game.data
    - user presses create a game from /u/games list
    - once response/event arrives, list gets updated
    - entry (game) has open button
    - on click, tabs open with the current state of the game
  - user changes settings of the game -> game.data
  - once finished, user presses 'invite' or 'game ready' or 'open' -> game.data game becomes visible in the list and joinable
  - opponent joins ( if rating >= specified by the host in settings) -> game.data
  - more settings, bans, both press 'ready' -> game.data
  - host presses 'start the game' -> game.data
  - all ingame events are sent through ingame.events topic
  - if user closes the tab, they can reopen it from 'ongoing games' list -> get current state snapshots from game.data and ingame.events
  - after the game has started, host can't cancel it
- app's proc-streams is wrong: should be a process per streams app, imported and started exlicitly with args
- buffer size 1 chans with peek and ? possible ? to convey db connections etc. Or is there another way ? Single process per connection + messages
  - (recur conn) to be able to close or smth before new is taken from the queue
- localStorage tokens: user1 token user2 token ... for multiple tabs
- no ffing sessions
- css via classes
- system
  - share connections via channels ? yes
    - db process handles db connection and db calls
    - first interceptor does not add db conn to ctx: it adds db process channel
    - query/tx interceptors open a go block, create a channel and put it on db channel with db fn symbol argv for db fn, and block until channel receives the result
    - db ns contains fns that take conn and args, so can be arbitrarily complex
    - the db channel takes all db calls - tx or queries - and launches non-blocking sub processes with that interceptor created channel and db args as args
    - a sub process is a go block that awains the result of the db call and puts it directly on the interceptor channel
    - interceptor go block returns with the db call result
    - error handling and reporting ?
    - testing
      - generate data using spec and fdef for db fn when inside the subprocess's go block
      - so in one case db request is made, in another generated data
      - so spec query fns
      - also test the chain fromthe request side with generated data
  - some of the processes
    - connections: db kafka
    - socket: into-channel/connect/disconnect/broadcast
    - kafka: producer arbiter
  - db is a lib, error handling in layers (http, socket, kafka)
  - db has all logic, interceptors only call
  - on no db in interceptors throw, appropriate response for errors (via match)
- namespacing
  - consolidate processes in main
  - crux, http, streams as a file
- channels
  - def channels as a map :name (chan)
  - destructure arg in proc itself
  - pass to process with (select-keys) to explicitly see what process depends on
  - it's infinitely worth it to use both (sleect-keys) + destructiring 
  - interceptors 
    - pass channels explicitly in main within http process
    - pedestal server is already a process
    - interceptors allow to make decisions inside that process
    - interceptors handle http (forming response maps), not actual domain logic
    - put logic into core ns, where each fn takes 1 arg - channels and returns a channel
    - this way interceptors are free of non-http decision making
- performance
  - performance-wise it is a question, whether or not connection should be accessed via a process or as a ref
  - and other considerations may arise
  - approach
    - test/perf will contain independent ns (apps) with their own entry points
    - once user abstraction is implemented and tested, copy a snapthot of the app into test/perf/alpha-channels1
    - and into test/perf/alpha-refs1
    - change refs1, test both
    - this way is better to reason about what option is better, than comlecting src files to handle all cases
- sockets
  - proc-socket accepts connections
  - proc-socket spawn sub-porcess per created game, which broadcasts events from users and sends them to kafka
  - once game is closed, sub-proc closes connections
  - when user reconnects, subproc conveys msg that game state is needed, gets it and sends to the reconnected user
  - games are looked up in a globalktable
  - only finished/selected games and events are persisted to db
  - user events, processed by subproc, are sent (non-block) to kafka and globalktable gets updated
  - kconsumer may not be required
- authtication and authorization
  - primary (and may be only) way to ligin will be using google, github, etc.
  - but username/pass login system will be there until 1.0
  - username is unique, users can change username freely
  - creating account data: username pass email(won't be used) and possibly questions to remeber pass
  - data is persisted in db, gktable [uuid user-rec] is updated
  - no need to [username user-rec] lookup: on login db query will do
  - authenticaiton is stateless using JWS/JWE, encoding user uuid and expiration
  - on requests, token is decoded into uuid and user record (with authorization info as well) is looked up in gktable
- proc-arbiter
  - on game events (:created :started) vals will be put on queue with insts and (timeout x) for when arbiter needs to emit and event to game
  - so if no events happen , timeouts (but not intervals, created by events) will be (alts!) and proc will close/remove the game
  - would be nice not to interval for every game, queue is preferred
  - once-a-few hours (timeout []) may be enqueued to remove stale games
- game events on the client and disconnect
  - the process will aplly events to the state and send to the server
  - if disconented, explicit non-blocking 'reconnecting' message will be shown
  - ui will sta responsive, game will be explorable, but the events will not be applied to state (execpt local ui related)
  - but the process will discard all events (vals on queue) that require connection
  - once reconnected, event conveyance will resume
- client and server exhange
  - it is a synchronization of state between to core.async processes over two channels(queues)
- queues, processes, rendering and derived state
  - react is an out/in: renders ui and collects inputs
  - reagent solves the update problem: components can selectively deref atoms or cursors and update lazily
  - inputs will put! vals on channles and processes will make requests
  - however, ui requires a lot of derived state
  - when a button click will initiate request, proccess will handle it and put! response on a queue
  - but for ui that is not enough: there should be loading state and derived state, that will most likely be used in multiple compoenets
  - with loading solution is a process, that will sub to certain queues and will be updating a derived state atom with data like [:some-logic :in-progress] [:some-logic :complete]
  - components will opt-in by derefing that atom and render
  - however, some state will contain a lot of conditional logic and will need to depend on other derived state
  - possible solution: 
    - communication is done via channles only, obviuosly
    - represent derived state as a reagent atom or atoms
    - a process or processes sub to channels and update derived state
    - components react to atoms or with cursor
    - there are also fns created with .e.g. '(derived-state (fn [ctx  old-val c-out] (let [a (deref :x) b (deref :y)] ...))
    - they compute some derived state and put! it on a channel
    - that value becomes a :key in derived state atom(s)
    - but these functions, alike reagent components, must be auto-invoked whenever atoms/cursors they deref change
    - they may be a go block and make async calls
  - on reagent's ratom
    - https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/src/reagent/ratom.cljs
    - track and track! allow to create derived state values that are first class RAtoms
    - but: they don't allow for fns to return go-block (channel), unlike pedestal, which is built with async
    - this can be added: if returned value is a channel, take! and apply result on arrival (via take! callback)
    - approach
      - go without async derived values
      - if they are neccessary, fork-implement
- queues, processes, rendering and derived state 2
  - use datascript as store for data
  - a create-user button click for the system is create-user value on the queue
  - an proc-http is subbed performs a request
  - a proc-transactor is subbed and performs datascript txns from vals
  - a proc-derived-state-ui is subbed and has a mapping from value types (:inputs/create-user :http-response/create-user ...) to db query keys (:query-1 :query-2 ...)
  - it queries the db (via a channel, sends query keys) and performs swap! on derived state (reagent atom) :query-1 val :query-2 val
  - only the corresponding ui (that has cursors to  :db :query-1 :db :query-2) will be updated
  - it may be better than rections as it brings a higher yet generic abstraction datalog
  - on practice, for ui those queries will be simple like getting loading state, current user etc, no need for relational logic
  - but: for the game it will be neccessary to query entities, so it may be benefitial overall
- project's idea and focus
  - the center of the project is the game and events, not user profiles
  - the scope is targeted at creating the game that shines, not pleasing or feature-bloating
  - thus, user profile is simple: a name and stats, event results 
  - home page is events, events are the core, more important than games
  - if user is in a game, it is shown (header/popup) so user could reopen it
  - creating a gmae means opening a tab with unique url, configuring it (e.g. host lists who is invited) and pressing open
  - after game is opened , others can open a link and press join
  - if game is private or deleted or not opened yet, opening a link will show 'game not found'
  - project is
    - /events - lists events, can join them (later may be introduced /events/hsitory or /events/data)
    - /games - lists games to join and/or ladder
    - /signup /singin /account  - basics to create a simple account
    - /stats/user/:username - a stats page showing user's stats
    - /game/:id - a unique url at which a game is played/observed
    - /event/:id - a unique url for an event
  - user's idetity (signup, account) consists of
    - credentials and a list of links
  - when user name is hovered/clicked, popup shows username, links and a link to /stats/user/username
  - game and event can also have a list of links (can be changed by host)
  - system has no chat by design
- events history, stats and data
  - games are played on a topic
  - once game is complete, a kstreams app should start
    - it will filter, map(xform) games and output transactable data
    - data is transacted into a separate history(stats) crux db (that has its own topics
    - and the data can be queried with datalog
- db ops
  - db ops should be named keywords, remove 'how' assoc-in-* etc) -> :db.op/this :db.op/that (including datalog queries, keywords for which are also needed to update queries)
- game.cljc
  - spec
  - derived state fns
  - reagent components
  - ? proc-game
  - derived-core is both palin data (for kstreams inference) and a ratom (for ui)
  - :g.state/core  is events and :g.state/derived-core - this is what server knows
  - other state is derived, is in ratoms with tracks 
  - track fns may use core logic
  - may transact to datascript, use :named/queries which are requries on events and results are keys on the map and can be (r/cursor)
  - ui import game as a lib, runs the proc with args, and conveys data via a channel
- gameplay
  - first, generate entities
    - strive for templates: parametarized generation, possibly in layers, with regions
    - start simple: using tesk.check, generate within given proportions
  - game map has min max x and y
  - there are no tiles: only positions (coordinates) of entities
  - when entity is enters, it has a position
  - once generated, entties go into datalog db
  - movement on the map is free as in no pathing
  - it is about spending/restoring energy, focus by taking different actions
  - distance only matters in that you spend energy etc.
  - also areas (fields etc.) matter, but going from point A to B is a straint line, but some resources will be spent/gained
  - interacting with map enetities leads to everything else
  - e.g.
    - :e.g/move-cape
    - event is applied to state
    - db query 'what else is in cape's position' is recomputed
    - track! reacts to :db.query/what-else-in-capes-pos change and computes data for a display/popup
    - inputs(buttons) are rendered with cape's options
    - user  inputs/clicks (it's optional of course, can just move to another pos) -> futher events
  - pool of positions, from whcih entities draw
    - pool can be divied into subsets that represent regions
    - entites can draw with contraints(template) applied
  - color of the tile and other tile-specific values
    - derived state, that is computed with track!
    - for example, a db query 'what are combined field values for tiles' updates, track updates {[x y] {:color new-val-representing-combined-field}}
    - same for drawing circles (that are field range): db query find all entites that have fields, their fields, track computes circles, renderer draws
  - entities qualities
    - are actually generated and differer every time (within a limit of a set)
    - and every quality gets random value as well
    - qualities are tupled(can be 2 3 4 for example) and player can choose a tuple
  - fields also vary on generation
  - when map is created, positions of entities align with a template, but are random and entities(fields) have new qualities
  - players are in equal positions always: after map is generated, there is no randomness, and both players can interact with any entity , no race/first-come condition
- assets, generation & serialization
  - generate assets into Blob and use with createObjectURL, or pre-render to use with (r/as-element)
  - an asset is code (a function)
  - if needed, generating can be done on worker thread
  - to avoid hitting ui thread with heavy deserialization (worker sends bytes or string)
    - send event :start-generation to worker
    - worker generates in batches and sends events :generated-batch 1 of 10 2 of 10 etc
    - finally, :generation-complete event, which trigger ui change
    - while it's in process, ui thread is completely free and responsive, with no serialization spikes
