    - notes
      - kafka is clojure-ish
      - kafka is for immutable distributed compute
      - industry is moving towards immutable timeseries compute
      - distributed only care about the raw thruth of data coming into the system
        - data locality
        - data temporality
        - data durability
        - data partitioning
      - orient yourself differently
      - brilliant and clear explanation of distribution
      - of what kafka does
      - integrant
        - "intergrant is the very best method to raising data into system state in clj world today"
      - "backless"
      - 100% simulated version of a product (runs in the browser) that is legitemate
      - 0 protocols
        - for solutions, I concur
      - kafka
        - programmatic model for
        - real-time
        - scalable
        - available
        - immutable
        - distributed 
        - compute
